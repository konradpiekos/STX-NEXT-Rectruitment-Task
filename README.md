# STX-NEXT-Rectruitment-Task

For this app I used:
- Python 3.7
- JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition 2019.1.3 x64

App is avaible at urls: 
1. http://127.0.0.1:5000/books/integer You can sort books in file "STX Next input data.json file" by date of publishing. To do that You should copy url address. Instead of integer you should write choosed year
2. http://127.0.0.1:5000//books/first_name/last_name You can sort books in file "STX Next input data.json file" by author. Instead of first_name use choosen author first name, instead of last_name use choosed author last name
3. http://127.0.0.1:5000//books/book_title You can find information about chosen book in file "STX Next input data.json file". Instead of book_title use chosen book title
